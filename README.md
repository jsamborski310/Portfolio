## Description

Prior to embarking on building my first React application, I laid out the design in Adobe XD. The portfolio provides future potential employers with an overview about myself, the tools I'm skilled with, and applications I have built.  

The UI is clean, polished, and the User will be able to navigate the site with ease.

This application was built using the following:

* HTML & CSS
* Javascript
* React
* Bootstrap
