## Description

Prior to embarking on building my first React application, I laid out the design in Adobe XD. The portfolio provides future potential employers with an overview about myself, the tools I'm skilled with, and applications I have built, and various way on how to reach me. 

Using the Bootstrap framework and CSS, I implemented the design. There are a few custom elements I incorporated: offcanvas menu and accordion. 

The UI is clean, polished, and the User will be able to navigate the site with ease. I have also ensured that it is mobile responsive.

This application was built using the following:

* HTML & CSS
* Javascript
* React
* Bootstrap
